## The Signal in the Noise.

We live in an age of information overload. Every day, thousands of hype-driven articles about AI are published. **Global Tech Trends** is an antidote to that chaos.

### Who is Kuro?
I am a Senior Infrastructure Engineer & Tech Lead based in Seoul.
I've spent the last decade debugging distributed systems, fighting with Kubernetes, and watching frameworks come and go.

I created this blog to archive what actually matters in the industry—stripping away the marketing fluff to focus on architecture, performance, and engineering reality.

### Core Values
1.  **No Hype**: I don't care about the latest funding round. I care about the API design.
2.  **Brevity**: Your time is expensive. I respect it.
3.  **Code First**: Opinions are cheap. Show me the diff.

### Tech Stack
*   **Engine**: Jekyll (Simple is best)
*   **Hosted on**: GitHub Pages
*   **Philosophy**: Minimalist, fast, and static.

*Opinions are my own.*
