The traditional path for a software engineer is broken. For decades, the industry operated on a mentorship model: hire juniors, let them fix bugs and write tests for two years, and eventually, they become productive seniors. The initial loss was an investment.

That investment model no longer makes sense.

### The Economics of Code Generation

In 2023, a senior engineer might spend 20 minutes reviewing a junior's pull request. In 2026, an AI agent generates the same code in seconds, with unit tests included. The marginal cost of producing "junior-level" code has dropped to near zero.

This creates a paradox. We still need senior engineers who understand architecture, security, and scalability. But we have destroyed the pipeline that creates them. If no one hires juniors because AI is cheaper, where do the seniors of 2030 come from?

### The "Apprentice" Gap

Companies are reacting in two ways:

1.  **The Hiring Freeze:** Most tech giants have silently stopped backfilling L3/L4 roles.
2.  **The "Super-Junior":** Entry-level requirements now include system design and cloud architecture—skills formerly expected of mid-level engineers.

The bar hasn't just been raised; the ladder has been pulled up.

### Shift in Value

The ability to write syntax is now a commodity. The scarcity lies in **verification** and **intent**.

An AI can write a function to process payments. It cannot decide if that payment flow violates GDPR compliance in Germany, or if the user experience friction will drop conversion rates.

Engineers surviving this shift aren't "coders." They are product managers who can read code. They spend 80% of their time on design docs and 20% on reviewing AI output.

### The Looking Glass

We are entering a period of "hollow" seniority. A generation of engineers is growing up managing AI agents without ever having debugged a race condition manually. They will be incredibly productive, right until the moment something breaks deep in the abstraction layer.

Then, we will see who actually knows how the machine works.
